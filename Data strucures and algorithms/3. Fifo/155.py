"""
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

"""

"""
Intuition:
Have two stacks intialized. One for the normal stack and the other for the minimum value at each stack value that is added. Everytime we add a vaue into the stack, check whether the value added is smaller than the previous minimum value. Add said value into the 
min stack.
